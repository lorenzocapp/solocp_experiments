# solocp_experiments
Include the code to reproduce the experiments in the change point detection paper using spike and slab priors


The two master files reproduce the results in Sections 4.1 (case  nt=1) and Section 4.2 (case nt=2). The other files are auxiliary files that need  to be loaded in order to run the corresponding master files. The master files include more configurations than the ones include in the paper. Check the paper for the exact specifics of the simulations included.
