Include the code to reproduce the experiments in the following paper 

1.  Cappello, L., Madrid Padilla, O. H., Palacios, J. A. (2022), Bayesian change point detection with spike and slab priors. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10383)

The main files are simulations.R and simulations_binned.R. The first one deals with the case that a single observation is observed for each time instance. The second one deals with the case where multiple observations are observed at each time instance.  The other files are auxiliary files that need to be loaded to run the corresponding master files. The master files include more configurations than the ones include in the paper. Check the paper for the exact specifics of the simulations included.
